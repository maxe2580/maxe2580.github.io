            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is <strong>Max Einspinner</strong>. I live in Mona Vale on Sydney’s Northern Beaches and enjoy 
                spending time outdoors, especially surfing, camping, and exploring new places. I am currently studying 
                at the <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au/">Australian Catholic University</a>, undertaking a double 
                degree in Secondary Education and Design and Technology. In my free time, I love designing and creating 
                furniture and products, combining creativity with practical skills.

            <h2>My Passion for Teaching</h2>
            <p>
                My passion for teaching comes from my own experiences in school. I was not a high-achieving student, 
                and many of my friends left school early. What changed things for me was having teachers who genuinely 
                believed in me and encouraged me to believe in myself. Their support showed me that with the right 
                guidance and confidence, students can achieve far more than they think both in school and in life. 
                I want to be that kind of teacher for my students, helping them recognise their potential and giving 
                them the self-belief to succeed.

            <h2>My Teaching Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from school in 2022 and was awarded a scholarship from the Catholic Schools of Broken Bay, 
                which led to my first role in education at Mater Maria Catholic College. For two years, I worked in 
                learning support, gaining valuable experience in helping students with diverse needs. I then transferred 
                to St Paul’s Manly, where I taught Stage 5 and Stage 6 Design and Technology and Timber. During my time 
                there, I successfully guided a major work class of Timber students, an experience that strengthened my 
                passion for teaching. Alongside my school roles, I have been studying at university since 2023 and am 
                on track to graduate in 2026. Outside of the classroom, I have worked at Carlile Swimming since 2021, 
                teaching squads, supervising shifts, and fostering a positive and disciplined environment for young swimmers.

            <h2>My Area of Expertise</h2>
            <p>
                My area of expertise is timber technology, which is my major at university and something I have been 
                passionate about since completing my own major work in 2022. Since then, I have developed a strong 
                interest in high-end furniture making, creating small projects in my spare time. Working within the 
                constraints of limited time and resources has pushed me further into the Design and Technology space, 
                where I enjoy solving real-world problems with specific users in mind. In addition to timber, I have 
                experience in food technology, which is my university minor. I have both participated in and taught 
                food classes, giving me a broad skill set across multiple practical subject areas.

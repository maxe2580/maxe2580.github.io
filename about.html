     <h2>About me </h2>
     <p>My name is <strong>Max Einspinner</strong>. I live in Mona Vale on Sydneyâ€™s Northern Beaches and enjoy spending time outdoors, especially surfing, camping, and exploring new places. I am currently studying at the <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au/">Australian Catholic University</a>, undertaking a double degree in Secondary Education and Design and Technology. In my free time, I love designing and creating furniture and products, combining creativity with practical skills.</p>

            <!-- Paragraphs describing teaching philosophy and beliefs -->
            <p>I believe in creating inclusive, hands-on learning environments where every student has the opportunity to discover their potential and take pride in their achievements. My teaching is grounded in encouragement, accessibility, and growth â€“ I design projects that allow students to engage practically with materials, tools, and design processes, giving them a sense of accomplishment beyond grades.</p>

            <p>I am especially passionate about supporting students who may not traditionally excel in school, as I understand firsthand how challenging that can feel. Through woodwork projects, I aim to empower all learners to develop practical skills, creativity, and confidence, showing them just how capable they truly are.</p>

            <p>Whether students are designing furniture, creating decorative objects, or exploring functional constructions, I encourage problem-solving, iteration, and personal expression, helping them see themselves as capable makers and designers who can achieve remarkable outcomes.</p>

            <!-- Paragraphs expanding on teaching philosophy and methods -->
            <p>Central to my philosophy is the belief that education should inspire students and provide opportunities for every learner to realise their potential. I am committed to social justice in the classroom, ensuring that all students, including those who may struggle in traditional academic settings, have the chance to succeed and feel proud of their achievements.</p>

            <p>In my woodwork teaching, I integrate hands-on, project-based learning that fosters creativity, problem-solving, and practical skill development. I intentionally create inclusive, accessible, and supportive learning environments, while embedding awareness of sustainability, craftsmanship, and ethical practice.</p>

            <p>I aim to model lifelong learning by exploring new materials, techniques, and industry practices, and by continuously reflecting on and refining my own teaching. My goal is for students to leave my classroom not only with skills and knowledge, but with confidence, curiosity, and a sense of what they are capable of achieving.</p>

            <p>Playing calming music supports a variety of student needs by aiding sensory regulation, maintaining focus, and reducing stress during hands-on, project-based activities, especially for junior classes. You can explore the playlist I use to create this environment below.</p>
